# BME280 Temperature Sensor
This project uses a BME280 sensor to read temperature, pressure, and humidity. During testing, these values were read in the debug console, but the values for each variable are stored in a float in main.c. *Please note that this project was designed and tested on a nucleo F303RE board, and so you may need to adjust pinout accordingly.*

**All resources are linked down below.**

### Setup
To setup the project, I first followed the tutorial to configure the clock and communication channel, enabling the crystal clock and setting it to 72Mhz. I also enabled I2C (though this sensor supports SPI as well) and turned on the Serial Wire debug. From Siger's repository, I copied the [`BME280_STM32.c`](./Core/Src/BME280_STM32.c) and [`BME280_STM32.h`](./Core/Src/BME280_STM32.c) files and also the main file. 

### Code
There are three floats defined in `main.c`: Temperature, Pressure, and Humidity. These variables can be used how you like. There's also a `BME280_Config` function that configures the BME280; the settings used work well at room temperature indoors. The documentation for this function can be found in the documentation comment for the function declaration in [`BME280_STM32.h`](./Core/Src/BME280_STM32.h). 

In the main while loop, use `BME280_Measure()` to measure, and you can change `HAL_Delay(<delay_in_milliseconds>)` to whatever you like, or even remove it. 

To see the values of temp/pressure/humidity, do the following: 
- build the project -
- run in debug mode
- open the debug menu in the upper right corner
- go to live expressions
- add expressions for "Temperature", "Pressure", and "Humidity" (I am unsure if these are case sensitive)
- run in debug mode.

### Cautions

- As stated in Siger's repository, use a resistor between 2 kOhms and 10 kOhms
- Make sure to use 3.3V
- Make sure your pinout is correct
- Make sure to click debug instead of run to be able to view the variables in the debug menu!

### Clock Configuration

The tutorial set the maximum clock frequency to `72Mhz`, and I did too. This works. Changing the maximum frequency can cause the sensor to fail to read data; I believe this is because of the synchronous nature of I2C (I think this is mentioned in the tutorial, but I skipped most of it). The sensor works on `72Mhz` and `36Mhz`, but fails on `18Mhz` and `9Mhz`. My guess is that since I2C sends data in packets of 9 bits, the clock frequency has to be a multiple of 9 and greater than some unknown threshold, though I'm not 100% sure. You can read more about it in the pages linked below.
